This is my MSc repo, where i produced several spatial heat maps using data from SANBI and several other studies. The aim here was to produce a map of hydrological refugia in the Cape Floristic Region, by producing maps of narrow-range endemisim, wetland-dependent narrow-range endemisim and total species.
